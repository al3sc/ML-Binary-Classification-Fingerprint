# ML Binary Classification Fingerprint
This repository contains the project developed as part of the "Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition" course at the Politecnico di Torino.
The project focuses on a binary classification problem. The goal is to perform fingerprint spoofing detection, i.e. to identify genuine vs counterfeit fingerprint images.

The dataset consists of labeled samples corresponding to the genuine (True, label 1) class and the fake (False, label 0) class. The data is 6-dimensional.

The main objectives include:

- Data visualization: understand the features distributions of the samples
- Dimensionality Reduction: exploring dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and LDA.
